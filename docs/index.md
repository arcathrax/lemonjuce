# Getting started
Welcome to arcathrax's JUCE documentation. This, by no means, should replace the regular JUCE documentation and is most likely **incomplete**. This documentation should help beginners and advanced users, to understand the JUCE stuff better.

## What is this?
This is a repository of notes and tutorials for the JUCE framework. This documentation too is written in a "more human readable way" than the official JUCE documentation. I know, that some people will prefer the offical JUCE documentation over this one and this repository is **not a replacement** for the official JUCE documentation. This should just provide even more ressources on JUCE and maybe in a pleasant way than the offical JUCE docs.

## Why?
I created this alternative documentation because I found, that the JUCE documentation is very hard to read and to get into. I often found myself staring at some code, that I didn't understand or looking through some old forum posts by someone, that had the same issue. I think, this is not the best way to get started and can be very frustrating. Because of this I am writing this.
