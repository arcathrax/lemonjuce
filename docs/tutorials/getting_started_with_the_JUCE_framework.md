# Getting started with the JUCE framework
To start as a beginner, I clearly suggest you to use *Projucer*. This is a application, provided by JUCE, to simplify the configuration and setup for your project. Here you will learn, how to install and use it with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (macOS) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Windows).

## Getting started
First, you need to download JUCE. You can download juce [here](https://juce.com/download/). Scroll a bit down and under *Download from this website*, choose your operating system.
