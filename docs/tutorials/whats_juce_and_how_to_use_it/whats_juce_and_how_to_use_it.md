# Whats JUCE and how to use it
JUCE is a framework for the programming language *C++*. This maybe doesn't sound like much to you, but it will make sense in a second.

## Prerequisites
- None

## What is a framework?
Imagine this scenario:
You want to build a house. To make your life more easy you use tools to help you out. So you buy a screwdriver, a hammer and a wood saw. Also you need resources for building. So you too buy wood and some cement. (This is a really simple example, I know.)

This is just like a framework. A framework provides you a set of "tools", that you can use. Of course, you don't need to use those tools, however your life will get significantly easier, if you use them.


## What tools does JUCE have?
JUCE ...

- can create a window for you
- can display stuff in that window for you
- can provide you with audio data
- can help you to do something with that audio data

...and much more.


## A common misconception? (I think)
I thought for a really long time, that JUCE was especially made for audio plugins. This however, is not really true. JUCE is optimized for audio applications, however you too can create regular applications with it.
